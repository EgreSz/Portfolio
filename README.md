### Projects
## Outsourcing Team and Workflow Optimization for Cold Outreach Campaign

### Challenge/Problem:
Over the past few years, BDA has focused on rapid growth, allocating a significant portion of its budget to cold call outreach. However, the onset of COVID-19 forced the company to shift from an in-office process to a remote environment. This transition severely impacted the business's finances, leading to a tight budget and insufficient staff to meet the company’s ambitious goals. After two months of implementing the new outsourced team, a new issue arose: 2/3 of calls were either not answered or were hung up, negatively affecting conversion rates.

### Role and Responsibilities:
As a Business Development & Operations Consultant, I led the effort to outsource the cold call outreach campaign and later worked as a liaison between stakeholders and the IT team to address emerging issues. My responsibilities included analyzing sales processes, proposing solutions to increase efficiency, managing the hiring process, improving workflows, and optimizing technology implementation.

### Actions Taken:
#### Phase 1: Team Building
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the existing sales process to develop a solution that aligned with the company’s culture and objectives.
- Segmented the sales team into two specialized groups: an "Opener Team" and a "Closer Team." This structure allowed the experienced team members to focus on closing deals, while the "Opener Team" handled initial outreach.
- I helped in the hiring process of a remote international team from Latin America to serve as the "Opener Team," enabling outreach to both Spanish and English-speaking business owners.

#### Phase 2: Workflow Improvement
- Problem: After two months of completing Phase 1, the client expressed concern about the conversion rate, noting that 2/3 of calls were not answered 
- I acted as a liaison between stakeholders and the IT team. My deep understanding of the sales process enabled me to collaborate effectively with IT to implement necessary adjustments to the predictive dialer.
- Analyzed sales data and found that calls lasting longer than 2 minutes had a lower hang-up rate and a higher success rate in transferring to closers. The solution was to work with IT to implement a predictive dialer that dialed multiple phone numbers simultaneously, connecting agents only when a live person answered, thereby significantly increasing the efficiency of the cold-calling campaign.

### Results/Impact:
#### Team Building Phase:
- Hired an international team of 20 sales representatives who handled an average of 4873 calls per day.
- Increased daily call volume by 244%, significantly boosting outreach efforts.
- Reduced operating costs by 50%, as the company could hire twice as many representatives within the same budget.
- Improved conversion rate by 150% within the first month following the onboarding and training of the new team.

#### Workflow Improvement Phase:
- Efficiency: Total calls taken by agents decreased by 41%, reflecting the dialer’s efficiency in filtering out unproductive calls.
- Conversation Rate: The conversation rate (meaningful conversations with leads) improved from 33% to 51%, even with a slight decrease in total conversations started.
- Conversion Rate: The conversion rate saw a 45% increase, enhancing the effectiveness of closing deals.
- Team Motivation: Although not formally measured, feedback indicated that team motivation improved, as agents felt more engaged and optimistic about meeting sales and compensation goals.
